# Introduction to Shell

1. Introducting the Shell
2. Navigating Files and Directories
3. Working with Files and Directories
  - Have students download and unzip a set of files for all human chromosomes (they have 21) - will be used later
  - Data
4. *Break*
5. Pipes and Filters
  - As in Nelle's pipeline, there will be some files that are messed up (different length), which will be obvious when they start sorting data by length
  - They'll need to fix these issues with the data before running their shell script
6. Loops
  - After introducting, will have students run their python script and produce a set of output plots comparing a couple stats for each chromosome file
7. Shell Scripts
  - Work the for loop into a nice script that they can save, which automates their analysis. They'll keep this shell script and their Python script for the later Git lesson
8. Finding Things
  - Some grep/find would be cool. I'll certainly cover some subsetting in Python, but shell is so powerful here.
  - Once they've cleaned their data and corrected issues, we'll have them concatenate all chromosome data together into one file, for later work in Python in Day 2.
  - Can use this combined dataset to play around with things like grep, and can also introduce cut/sort/uniq/etc.
